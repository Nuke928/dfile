# dfile, Simple file scanner

dfile is a fast, simple, and cross-platform binary file scanner that is very similar and inspired of the UNIX/BSD [file](https://github.com/file/file) utility.

A list of files where additional information can be provided is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/dd86k/dfile/wiki/Additional-Information).

Currently, dfile is only supported on little-endian machines. The behavior is undefined on big-endian machines.
